# WEBshot

WEBshot is an automated tool that allows you to capture screenshots of web pages without visiting them. This tool is fully written in Python and made use of the "Selenium" Browser Automation Project.

If you are a Bug hunter or a CTF player who often works with big web applications, this tool can save you a lot of time. You can let this run in the background and focus on the custom exploitation.

# Installation
`git clone https://github.com/kavishkagihan/WEBshot.git`

`cd WEBshot && chmod +x WEBshot`

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
